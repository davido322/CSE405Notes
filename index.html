		<p> Assignment1: <bl> Research: My goal is to develop a website using Node JS. My website is to include html files that run using CSS and JAVA script. I have researched the functions required to include HTML files in my server.js file. I also have started to develop a small website for a potential future client. My goal is to create a "dummy" site for a restaurant that I will later be able to fix up with my clients request to ultimately publish their site. </bl></p>
